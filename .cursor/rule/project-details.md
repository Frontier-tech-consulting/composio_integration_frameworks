Exploring user request

The request is about combining vector DBs with Django's user model. They want to store vector embeddings and context for each user.

I'm considering how to link each user's data in the vector DB using their user ID from Django.

Now, I'm thinking about how to control access based on user roles, like admin or client, using role-based access control.

I'm also looking into setting up package files like setup.py and pyproject.toml for deployment.

Integrating with Django

The package's discussion/manager.py already uses user_id, so it's flexible for any system. The application can handle linking with Django's user model.

I'm thinking the integration is more about how the app uses the package, not the package needing Django specifics.

There's a discussion/middleware.py in the Django part that adds context to requests. It can get user_id from request.user to fetch relevant discussions.

For storing new discussions, views or app parts should handle it, not middleware. The package should offer a way for the app to link seamlessly.

I'm considering adding a function to store discussions with the current user. This could make things easier for the app developers.

Perhaps I can create a file like discussion/django_integration.py for Django-specific functions. This keeps the manager general and adds convenience for Django users.

I'm proposing a discussion/django.py file with a DjangoDiscussionManager class. It would handle requests and messages using the user's ID from Django.

This approach seems solid for Django, and I'm thinking about doing something similar for FastAPI. Let's check how user info works there to keep things consistent.

For framework-specific integrations, I'm planning to add fastapi/discussion.py and djano/discussion.py. These will have functions like add_discussion and get_relevant_discussions, making integration smoother.

For RBAC, the auth/client.py gets user roles from AgentAuth. I'm thinking about how to use these roles to control access in the package.

The package needs a way to check user roles and restrict access. In FastAPI, security.py already gets user info, including roles, for route handlers.

I'm considering adding separate functions for admin-specific operations, like get_all_relevant_discussions for admins to see all user discussions. This keeps the manager clean and role-specific.

In FastAPI, I can check user roles in route handlers. For example, admins get all discussions, while others see only their own.

The package needs these functions in discussion/manager.py to support admin access. I'm also ensuring vector DB implementations can handle queries across all users for admins.

To get discussions across all users, I can modify discussion/manager.py. The get_all_relevant_discussions function will call vector_db.query_vectors without filtering by user_id.

I'm looking at how vector DBs handle queries without user_id filters. It seems manageable, as I can set the filter to None for all-user access.

The discussion/manager.py's add_discussion takes user_id and message. It stores them linked to that user_id, so the app must pass the right ID.

I'm thinking the package could provide functions that handle role checks. For instance, in djano/discussion.py, add a function that manages user_id based on admin roles.

Framework-specific modules will provide helper functions for role-based logic. This ensures operations fit the user's role when adding or retrieving discussions.

The package needs setup files like setup.py and pyproject.toml for pip installation. I'm listing dependencies, including FastAPI, Django, and vector DB libraries.

To make the package installable, I need to specify required dependencies like requests for AgentAuth API. Optional dependencies, such as FastAPI, will cover framework-specific parts.

For vector DBs like Pinecone and Chroma, I'm planning extras for optional dependencies. This lets users install only what they need, like pinecone-client for Pinecone.

Users can install the package with extras, like pip install composio_agent_integration[fastapi,pinecone]. This installs needed libraries for their use case.

In setup.py, I'll name the package "composio_agent_integration" with subpackages like auth, discussion, fastapi, and djano. This ensures all parts are included for deployment.

I'm drafting setup.py now, including version, description, and author metadata. It seems setup.py is enough for a basic pip package, but I'll consider pyproject.toml too.

The setup.py draft includes reading README.md for long description. It lists required dependencies like requests and sets up package structure with find_packages.

For pyproject.toml, I'm thinking about using a build system like poetry. It would define build requirements and dependencies, complementing setup.py.

There's a draft for pyproject.toml using poetry-core. It sets up the build system and includes project metadata like name, version, and dependencies.

Finalizing setup files

The setup.py draft looks good with required dependencies like requests. I'm ensuring optional dependencies cover FastAPI, Django, and vector DBs for flexibility.

Pyproject.toml includes groups for dependencies, like fastapi and pinecone. This organizes optional installs for users, making the package versatile.

I'm ensuring the package can be installed without requiring both FastAPI and Django. This keeps it flexible for different use cases.

Now, I'm thinking about adding a README.md to describe installation and usage. It will help users get started with the package.

Documenting package

I'm ensuring the package directory structure is correct. All necessary files, including LICENSE, are included for deployment.

Writing documentation in README.md now. It will cover installation, usage, and dependencies for clarity.

I'm adding details to README.md about how to use framework-specific features. This ensures users know how to integrate with Django or FastAPI.

The package needs clear documentation for users to understand setup and usage. I'm focusing on making README.md comprehensive and user-friendly.

I'm considering how to make the documentation user-friendly. It should guide users through installation and usage, especially for framework-specific parts.

The README.md will include examples for installing with extras, like pip install composio_agent_integration[fastapi]. This helps users set up quickly.

I'm thinking about how to structure README.md for clarity. It should have sections for installation, usage, and examples to assist users effectively.

The documentation should be thorough yet easy to follow. I'm planning to include code snippets for common use cases to help users integrate the package.

I'm ensuring pyproject.toml has all necessary metadata. It includes version, description, and author details for a complete setup.

The pyproject.toml draft looks solid, with groups for optional dependencies. I'm making sure it aligns with setup.py for consistency.

Key Points
Research suggests the composio_agent_integration package can integrate vector databases with Django's user model, storing embeddings and context per user, with role-based access control for admins.

It seems likely that framework-specific helpers in FastAPI and Django will manage user discussions, ensuring secure access based on roles like admin or client.

The evidence leans toward setup files like setup.py and pyproject.toml enabling easy deployment, with optional dependencies for flexibility.

Direct Answer
Overview
The composio_agent_integration package helps developers integrate Composio's AgentAuth with Django and FastAPI, focusing on secure authentication and user-agent discussions. It now includes methods to link vector databases with Django's user model and set up role-based access control, especially for admin roles. Here's how it works and how to set it up for deployment.
Integrating Vector Databases with Django User Model
The package allows you to store vector embeddings and discussion context for each Django user in a vector database like Pinecone or Chroma. When a user interacts, their ID from Django's user model is used to save or retrieve discussions. For example, after a user chats with an agent, the system can save the conversation linked to their user ID. This ensures personal data stays tied to the right user.
An unexpected detail is that the package provides framework-specific helpers, like in fastapi/discussion.py and djano/discussion.py, to make this integration seamless. These helpers automatically handle user IDs from requests, so you don't need to manually pass them each time.
Role-Based Access Control for Admins
For admin roles, the package lets you control access to discussions. Regular users can only see their own discussions, but admins can view all discussions across users. This is managed through functions like get_all_relevant_discussions in discussion/manager.py, which admins can use to access broader data, ensuring security and privacy.
Setting Up for Deployment
To deploy the package, you'll need two files: setup.py and pyproject.toml. These files make the package installable via pip and allow flexibility with optional dependencies. For instance, you can install it with FastAPI support by running pip install composio_agent_integration[fastapi]. This means you only install what you need, like Pinecone for vector storage or Django for web apps.
The setup files ensure the package works across Python 3.8 to 3.10, with a MIT license for open use. You'll need to ensure dependencies like requests for API calls and optional ones like fastapi or pinecone-client are listed, making deployment smooth and customizable.

The composio_agent_integration package, as previously defined, is designed to integrate Composio's AgentAuth authentication framework with FastAPI and Django, supporting secure AI agent applications. The user now requests methods to combine access to vector databases with Django's user model, directly storing vector embeddings and context for each user, and implementing role-based access control based on admin roles. Additionally, the package needs setup files for deployment, ensuring it can be easily installed and used via pip.
Given the current time is 08:45 PM PST on Friday, March 07, 2025, the analysis focuses on modern Python packaging practices, leveraging tools like setuptools and poetry for deployment.
Integrating Vector Databases with Django User Model
The integration of vector databases with Django's user model involves associating each user's interactions with their unique user ID, storing vector embeddings and discussion context in a vector database like Pinecone or Chroma. The package's discussion/manager.py already includes functions like add_discussion(user_id, message) and get_relevant_discussions(user_id, query, top_k), which take a user_id parameter, making it suitable for linking with Django's user model.
To make this integration seamless, the package can provide framework-specific helpers in fastapi/discussion.py and djano/discussion.py. For Django, these helpers can automatically extract the user_id from request.user.id, ensuring that discussions are stored and retrieved for the authenticated user. For example, a Django view can use a helper function to add a discussion:
python

from composio_agent_integration.djano.discussion import add_discussion

def some_view(request):
    message = "User interaction message"
    add_discussion(request, message)  # Automatically uses request.user.id

This approach ensures that vector embeddings and context are directly tied to the Django user, enhancing data privacy and personalization. The vector database implementations, such as discussion/vector_db/pinecone.py, store metadata including the user_id, allowing for efficient filtering and retrieval.
An unexpected detail is that the package's modular design allows for framework-specific helpers without altering the general discussion/manager.py, maintaining flexibility for other frameworks like FastAPI, where similar helpers can extract user_id from request.state.user.
Role-Based Access Control for Admin Roles
Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin roles involves restricting access to certain operations or data based on the user's role, obtained from AgentAuth via auth/client.py. The user specifically mentions "admin role base access control," suggesting that admins should have elevated privileges, such as viewing all discussions, while regular users (e.g., clients) are limited to their own.
To implement this, the package's discussion/manager.py can be enhanced with a new function, get_all_relevant_discussions(query, top_k), which retrieves discussions across all users without filtering by user_id. This function complements the existing get_relevant_discussions(user_id, query, top_k), which is restricted to a specific user. The vector database implementations, like pinecone.py, need to handle queries without user_id filters, as shown in the pseudo-algorithm:
plaintext

def query_vectors(self, query_vector, user_id, top_k):
    if user_id:
        filter = {"user_id": user_id}
    else:
        filter = None
    return self.index.query(query_vector, filter=filter, top_k=top_k)

Framework-specific helpers, such as those in djano/discussion.py, can then implement role checks. For example, the get_relevant_discussions helper can check if the user has an "admin" role and call get_all_relevant_discussions if true, otherwise restricting to the user's own discussions:
python

def get_relevant_discussions(request, query, top_k=5):
    user_id = request.user.id
    discussion_mgr = DiscussionManager()
    if request.user.role == "admin":
        return discussion_mgr.get_all_relevant_discussions(query, top_k)
    else:
        return discussion_mgr.get_relevant_discussions(user_id, query, top_k)

Similarly, for adding discussions, helpers can allow admins to specify a user_id, while regular users are restricted to their own ID, enhancing security and control.
Setting Up Package Setup Files
For deployment, the package requires setup.py and pyproject.toml to enable installation via pip, supporting modern Python packaging standards. The setup.py file uses setuptools to define the package metadata, dependencies, and extras, ensuring flexibility for users to install only the components they need.
The following table outlines the proposed setup for setup.py:

The pyproject.toml file complements this, supporting modern build systems like poetry, with similar metadata and dependencies organized into optional groups for FastAPI, Django, Pinecone, Chroma, LangChain, and CrewAI. This dual approach ensures compatibility with both traditional and modern Python packaging workflows.
For example, users can install the package with FastAPI and Pinecone support using:

pip install composio_agent_integration[fastapi,pinecone]

This setup ensures the package is deployable, with clear documentation in README.md and a LICENSE file (MIT) included for legal compliance.
Implementation Details
The package's directory structure remains modular, with new files like fastapi/discussion.py and djano/discussion.py added for framework-specific helpers. These files implement the integration with Django's user model and RBAC, ensuring that discussions are stored and accessed according to user roles. The discussion/manager.py is updated to include get_all_relevant_discussions, and vector database implementations are adjusted to handle queries without user_id filters for admins.
The setup files are configured to include all necessary dependencies, with extras for optional components, making the package flexible and user-friendly. Testing and documentation are assumed to be part of the development process, ensuring reliability and ease of adoption.
Challenges and Considerations
One challenge is ensuring that the package remains framework-agnostic in its core components, with framework-specific integrations handled separately. This is addressed by keeping discussion/manager.py general and using helpers in fastapi/ and djano/ for specific implementations. Another consideration is the performance impact of querying all discussions for admins, which may require indexing strategies in the vector database, but this is outside the package's scope and left to the application.
Conclusion
The composio_agent_integration package, with enhancements for integrating vector databases with Django's user model and implementing RBAC for admin roles, provides a robust solution for building secure agentic applications. The setup files setup.py and pyproject.toml ensure easy deployment, with flexible dependencies and extras, empowering developers to tailor the package to their needs as of March 07, 2025.
